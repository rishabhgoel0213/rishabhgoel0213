# Hi there, I'm Rishabh Goel! 👋

## About Me

I'm a high schooler with interests in computer science, math, and physics. This account contains some projects related to machine learning, web development, and competitive programming. I enjoy exploring new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

- **NeuralNetCpp**: A complete implementation of a neural network in C++. 

- **KattisSolutions**: My solutions to various competitive programming problems from the Kattis database written in Java, Python, or C++. 

- **PMTWebsite**: Website for Phoenix Motor Sports Formula SAE Team, hosted on a DigitalOcean Droplet. 

- **RealPokerGame**: A fast-paced free-to-play poker game where you compete for rating points, developed in Dart.
