Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

- **NeuralNetCpp**: A complete implementation of a neural network in C++. 

- **CPSolutions**: My solutions to various competitive programming problems, written in Java.
  
- **ThanksgivingMealGenerator**: A simple and fun way to generate recipies for Thanksgiving dinner, based on GPT-3, written in Python. 

- **RealPokerGame**: A fast-paced free-to-play poker game where you compete for rating points, developed in Dart.
