## About Me

I'm a freshman at the Univeristy of Maryland with interests in computer science, math, and physics. This account contains some of the stuff I'm working on. 

## Projects

- **TrackerOnlyEmu**: A set of tools to emulate tracker responses at the CERN LHC, for which I implemeted bootstrapping for the L0 Hadron trigger mechanism emulation's uncertainty.
  
- **ZeroClone**: A general learning algorithm for two-player perfect informtion games, designed to be modular, inspired by Google DeepMind's AlphaZero.

- **ServerWebApps**: Private infrastructure built with Tailscale to quickly prototype and deploy personal-use web apps developed by OpenAI Codex. 

- **CPSolutions**: My solutions to various competitive programming problems, written in Java and C++.
  
- **RealPokerGame**: A fast-paced free-to-play poker game where you compete for rating points, developed in Dart.
