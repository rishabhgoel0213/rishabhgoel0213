## About Me

I'm a freshman at the Univeristy of Maryland with interests in computer science, math, and physics. This account contains some projects related to machine learning, web development, and competitive programming.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

- **ZeroClone**: A general learning algorithm for two-player perfect informtion games, designed to be modular, inspired by Google DeepMind's AlphaZero.

- **CPSolutions**: My solutions to various competitive programming problems, written in Java and C++.
  
- **RealPokerGame**: A fast-paced free-to-play poker game where you compete for rating points, developed in Dart.

- **NeuralNetCpp**: A complete implementation of a deep neural network, written in C++, tested on MNIST and MPG datasets.
  
- **ThanksgivingMealGenerator**: A simple and fun way to generate recipies for Thanksgiving dinner, based on GPT-3, written in Python.
